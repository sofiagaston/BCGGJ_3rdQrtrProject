Punching Game.

You are welcomed by a screen that opts you to press “START”. Once pressed, you will be redirected to the next page.

1. Press the selection button. You may choose heads or tails. 
2. Then, you press “FLIP”. If the coin is in your favor, you will attack first as the “defend” button will be disabled. If not, your opponent will. 
3. While playing, your HEALTH will be displayed on the screen. Both players’ health starts at 100. Each offense from the opponent will cost you damage ranging from 1-5. You are given the choice to strike or defend. 
4. Once a player’s health hits 0, the game ends. You have a choice to restart by playing the RESTART button.
